== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I programatically open or close a modal? =

Each modal is given a unique ID, which can be found inside the inspector controls of the block settings. It will look something like: `Mk6I8L4haJB`

To open a modal:

```
window.lightModalBlocks.get('modal-id-here').showModal(true);
```

To close a modal:

```
window.lightModalBlocks.get('modal-id-here').closeModal();
```

= How can I prevent focusing on the first focusable element when the modal opens? =

Paste the following code in your child themes **functions.php** file or similar:

```
/**
* Prevents the light modal block from focusing on a specific element when it opens.
*
* @return void
*/
add_action(
	'wp_enqueue_scripts',
	function () {
		wp_add_inline_script(
			'cloudcatch-light-modal-block-view-script',
			'window.lmbFocusableElements = "";',
			'before'
		);
	}
);
```

= How can I prevent scrolling when a modal is open? =

The class `lmb-open` is added to the `<body>` of the page when a modal is open. You can use the following CSS to prevent scrolling?

```
.lmb-open {
	overflow: hidden;
}
```
