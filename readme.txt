Each modal is given a unique ID, which can be found inside the inspector controls of the block settings. It will look something like: `Mk6I8L4haJB`

To open a modal:

    window.lightModalBlocks.get('modal-id-here').showModal(true);

To close a modal:

    window.lightModalBlocks.get('modal-id-here').closeModal();
